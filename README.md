# Portfolio
This is a repository of my portfolio in data science. In this space is a number of assets generated from the three projects I decided to include in my portfolio. This repository exists because of the space limitations of the 2MB limit for the work sample upload, and to provide more context for the images included in my portfolio. This repository is designed to be used with hyperlinks embedded in the Work Sample, but feel free to explore.   

The outputs of three projects are contained within this repository. A summary is contained in [Portfolio.pdf](https://github.com/w2ll2am/Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio.pdf) and includes:

 * Fluid mechanics of protoplanetary disks
 * Prevelence of racism in the UK rental market
 * Predictive Shock Absorbing Seats for the Royal Marines Landing Craft

The below animation is part of my dissertation, then research project, into simulating the formation of protoplanetary disks. This is the output of a simulation visulisation pipeine I developed in [Two Fluid Repository](https://github.com/w2ll2am/Two-Fluid-ISCA). This is generated from over 100GB of simulation data.
