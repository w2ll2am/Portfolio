# Portfolio
This is a repository of my portfolio in data science for my MPhil Data Intensive Science application. In this space is a number of assets generated from the three projects I decided to include in my Work Sample. This repository exists because of the space limitations of the 2MB limit for the work sample upload, and to provide more context for the images included in my Work Sample. This repository is designed to be used with hyperlinks embedded in the Work Sample, but feel free to explore.   

The outputs of three projects are contained within here. These are:

 * Fluid mechanics of protoplanetary disks
 * Prevelence of racism in the UK rental market
 * Predictive Shock Absorbing Seats for the Royal Marines Landing Craft

The animation below is the one example of the many of simulations I ran using code i wrote in [Two Fluid Repository](https://github.com/w2ll2am/Two-Fluid-ISCA). This is generated from over 100GB of simulation data.
